# Assets Directory

This directory holds all of the assets for the plugin.  It provides a modular architecture for all types of assets including:

- `styles` - holds the uncompressed CSS files.
- `scripts` - holds the uncompressed JavaScript files.
- `images` - holds any images including svgs, sprites, etc. 
- `dist` - holds the optimized stylesheets and scripts that are used in production.

If your project uses Sass or LESS, you can add either of those directories here.

If your project does have one or more of these assets, delete the folder.
